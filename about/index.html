            My journey began at UC Santa Cruz, where I studied Bioengineering
            and Plant Science and built the foundation for how I work today:
            careful observation, scientific rigor, and practical problem
            solving. At the UCSC Research Farm, I learned the day-to-day rhythm
            of field work and the value of decisions grounded in real conditions
            rather than theory alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            From there, I worked in an organic strawberry research lab and later
            interned in Stanford Plant Biology, studying root function using
            glowing plants. Those experiences gave me a deep respect for plant
            systems, data, and experimentation. I then worked at the UCSC Genome
            Browser doing genetics data visualization, where I sharpened my
            ability to translate complex biological information into useful,
            actionable insight.
          </p>

          <p>
            Back in applied fruit systems, I worked at Santa Cruz Fruit Growers
            testing tamarillo, goldenberry, and pepino dulce varieties. At the
            same time, I started building community-centered spaces by founding
            two community houses and planting orchards at each one. Those
            orchards became living classrooms where I taught grafting workshops
            and supported people in gaining practical skills and confidence.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a freelance fruit tree pruner, I worked across many types of
            sites and needs, helping trees recover, produce, and thrive safely
            over time. I later expanded into large-scale stewardship as land
            steward for a 300-acre forest estate, balancing ecological health,
            safety, and long-term management across a complex landscape.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, I work with Perma Gardens as lead caretaker of an 8-acre
            homestead and perennial vegetable and fruit breeding farm. My role
            brings everything together: scientific training, field experience,
            orchard design, tree care, breeding work, and education.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am a jack of all trades with a clear center: community, ethics,
            and safety. My approach is hands-on and collaborative, grounded in
            science, and committed to helping people build resilient fruit
            systems that serve both land and community for the long term.
